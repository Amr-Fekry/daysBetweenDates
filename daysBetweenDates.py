# Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age 
# in days. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday 
# and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). 
# Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays date is 
# 2 Jan 2012 you are 1 day old.



## 1.2- what are the outputs?

## what is the meaningful output assuming the inputs are valid? 
## check what the problem states, and if not clear enough, make the best guess.

## problem states "calculate your age in days" 
## -> best output: return a number giving the number of days between the first date and the second date.

## for definsive programming, what are the outputs for cases where the inputs are not valid?
## be creative writing error messages for the user.
