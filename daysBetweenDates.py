# Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age 
# in days. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday 
# and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). 
# Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays date is 
# 2 Jan 2012 you are 1 day old.



## 1- make sure you understand the problem before trying to solve it:
##   * a problem is defined by a set of possible inputs (usually infinite) and the relationship between them and the desired output.
##   * the solution is a function that can take any input in the set, and produces a desired output that satisfies the relationship.
