# Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age 
# in days. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday 
# and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). 
# Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays date is 
# 2 Jan 2012 you are 1 day old.



## 4- develop incrementally (small bits of code) and TEST as you go:
##    start breaking down the problem into small parts and make progress

##    "pseudo code" algorithm:

##    days = 0
##    while date1 is before date2:
##        days += 1
##        date1 = advance to next day
